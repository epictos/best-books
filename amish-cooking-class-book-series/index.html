<p>Brunstetter is one of the founders of the Amish fiction genre. I received a complimentary copy of this book from Netgalley and was under no obligation to post a review. Lyle and Heidi Troyer have taken in a brother and sister who were orphaned when their parents were killed in a car accident. Her series AMISH COOKING CLASS features three books. The two children lost their parents in an auto accident and have been living with the Troyers for the last four months.
