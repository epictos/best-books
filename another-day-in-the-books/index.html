<p>Another Day is a young adult romance and fantasy novel written by American author David LevithanThe novel was published on August 25 2015 through Random House Childrens Books. Every Day establishes the story line through the perspective of A a mystical soul who falls in love with a girl named Rhiannon. San Francisco has done a great job in the past two drafts of consistently selecting top prospects as they begin to slip on draft day and Borland appears to be another one of those players. Otherwise read the debut and skip the second book and jump straight into Someday youll probably enjoy the story much more and wont miss anything. Just me living another day trying to get back to normal. Another Day David Levithan Book Quotes Quotes Another Day David Levithan.</p>
