<p>Most banks have a pre-printed application form which youll have to fill for getting a new passbook. Considering my situation and need to prepare for my exam I earnestly request you to issue me these books from your library for a week- 1. When it comes to applying educational loan to bank it is important to submit required documents like address proof college bonafide certificate estimation of fees for upcoming years and fees receipt if you have already paid feeSo you should approach your college Principal and should write a formal letter requesting for issuing fee receipt. I passed class IX with 90 marks from this school. My exams are starting next week and I need these books to prepare for my subject. Pin On School Collage Application.</p>
