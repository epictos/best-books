<p>Alexander the Great is my hero and this is such a Great ha book about him. Alexanders story from his birth to his death is written in a manner for which I give full credit to Mr Freeman. Aug 22 2011. He insulted Alexanders pride. Knowing what created Alexander comes the closest to explaining what the man became. A Review Of Lord Of The Two Lands Two By Two Book Lovers Books.</p>
