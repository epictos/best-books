<p>The novels protagonist Patrick Bateman is a psychopath who also works on Wall Street. Courtney Lawrence Courtney one of Evelyn s closest friends is in a highly-unfulfilling relationship with Luis Carruthers and having an ongoing affair with Patrick Bateman. The investigator reveals to Bateman that he has an alibi for the night of the murder. There is no real plot. The collision of absurd reality and deranged fantasy still works a treat.
